> You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

> A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

> You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)
## Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

## Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
